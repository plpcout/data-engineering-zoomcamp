# Data ingestion with dlt

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This section includes:
>
> - A notebook ([dlt_explore.ipynb](1-workshop-exploring/dlt_explore.ipynb)) where I explored the basics of dlt to gain better understanding of the tool.
>   - The notebook is based on:
>     - Workshop material.
>     - The official DLT [documentation](https://dlthub.com/docs/intro).
> - And a slightly modified version of the [workshop material](1-workshop-exploring/README.md) with additional infos.

Welcome to this hands-on workshop, where you'll learn to build efficient and scalable data ingestion pipelines.

### **What will you learn in this workshop?**

In this workshop, you‚Äôll learn the core skills required to build and manage data pipelines:

- **How to build robust, scalable, and self-maintaining pipelines**.
- **Best practices**, like built-in data governance, for ensuring clean and reliable data flows.
- **Incremental loading techniques** to refresh data quickly and cost-effectively.
- **How to build a Data Lake** with dlt.

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to build data pipelines like a senior data engineer ‚Äî quickly, concisely, and with best practices baked in.

## üìñ Course overview

This workshop is structured into three key parts:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **[Extracting Data](1-workshop-exploring/README.md#extracting-data)** ‚Äì Learn scalable data extraction techniques.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **[Normalizing Data](1-workshop-exploring/README.md#normalizing-data)** ‚Äì Clean and structure data before loading.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **[Loading & Incremental Updates](1-workshop-exploring/README.md#loading-data)** ‚Äì Efficiently load and update data.
