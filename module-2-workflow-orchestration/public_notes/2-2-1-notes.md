# Workflow Orchestration Introduction

## 📌 Introduction

This is a modest introduction to **workflow orchestration** using **Kestra**.

For an in-depth look at **Kestra**, be sure to explore their [Kestra Docs](https://kestra.io/docs).

## 📝 Quick Overview

- Understanding **Workflow Orchestration**
- What is **Kestra** and why use it?
- Core concepts: **Tasks, Flows, and Executions**
- Building ETL Pipelines with **Kestra**s
- Deploying workflows on **Google Cloud**
- Using **parameters & scheduling** to make workflows dynamic
- **Monitoring & logging** execution states
- Integrating Kestra with **BigQuery, PostgreSQL, and cloud services**

## 🎼 What is Workflow Orchestration?

Workflow orchestration ensures that different parts of a data pipeline execute in a well-defined order, similar to how an orchestra follows a conductor to create harmonious music.

- Data pipelines involve multiple scripts and services.
- Running them **independently** is inefficient.
- Orchestration **coordinates execution**, ensuring smooth dependency handling.

## What is Kestra?

Kestra is an **event-driven data orchestration platform** designed for flexibility and ease of use. Originally developed for data orchestration, its **intuitive interface** and **extensive plugin support** make it suitable for a variety of pipeline automation needs.

## 🎯 Why Use Kestra?

**Kestra** is an **all-in-one orchestration platform** that:

- ✅ Handles **ETL workflows**.
- ✅ Supports **event-driven & scheduled executions**.
- ✅ Offers **low-code, no-code, and full-code flexibility**.
- ✅ Works with **multiple programming languages** (Python, Rust, C, etc.).
- ✅ Provides **monitoring, visualization, and logging**.
- ✅ Supports **600+ plugins**, integrating with tools like **GCP, Databricks, DBT, and Snowflake**.

## 🎓 Core Concepts of Kestra

### Flow Definition

A **flow** in Kestra is a structured YAML configuration that defines:

- **ID & Namespace**: Organizes workflows into logical groups.
- **Inputs**: Parameters used in execution.
- **Tasks**: The actual operations executed.
- **Dependencies**: How tasks rely on each other.

### Tasks

Tasks are individual steps in a workflow, which can be:

- 🏗️ **Extract**: Fetch data from APIs, databases, or storage.
- 🔄 **Transform**: Process and modify data.
- 📤 **Load**: Store data in databases or cloud platforms.

## 📊 Monitoring and Logging

- Kestra provides **visual monitoring** via a **Gantt Chart View**.
- Logs and task statuses are easily accessible.
- Users can **view historical executions** and **debug failures**.

## 📅 Scheduling & Parameters

- Flows can be scheduled using **cron-like expressions**.
- Parameters allow for **dynamic execution** without modifying code.
- Supports **backfills** to rerun past data when necessary.

- **Example**: Scheduling a daily flow at noon.
  - ```yaml
    schedule:
      type: cron
      value: "0 12 * * *" # Runs daily at noon
    ```

## ☁️ Deploying on Google Cloud

### 4 Simple steps:

1. **Install Kestra** on a cloud VM.
2. **Sync workflows from Git**.
3. **Connect Kestra to BigQuery & Storage**.
4. **Automate workflows in production**.

## ✅ Conclusion

Kestra simplifies workflow orchestration by offering:

- Scalable **ETL and data pipelines**.
- Flexible **low-code and full-code options**.
- Real-time **monitoring & logging**.
- Seamless **cloud integrations**.
