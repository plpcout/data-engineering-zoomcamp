# Introduction to Batch Processing and Apache Spark

## üìå Overview

Batch processing is a widely used method for handling large-scale data transformations at scheduled intervals. Apache Spark is a distributed computing engine designed for executing such batch jobs efficiently across single-node machines or clusters. This section explores batch processing, its advantages, and how Spark plays a crucial role in large-scale data processing.

## üìñ Summary

This section covers:

- The concept of batch processing and how it differs from streaming.
- Typical batch processing intervals such as **daily**, **hourly**, and **weekly** jobs.
- Common technologies used in batch processing, including **Python**, **SQL**, and **Spark**.
- Apache Spark‚Äôs role in distributed data processing.
- When to use Spark over traditional SQL-based processing.
- Typical Spark workflows and use cases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- The will to learn
- To get the most out of this; Minimal requirements:
  - Basic understanding of **SQL** and **Python**.
  - Familiarity with **data pipelines** and **workflow orchestration**.

## üîë Key Concepts

### Batch Processing vs. Streaming

- **Batch Processing**: Processes large chunks of accumulated data at scheduled intervals (e.g., daily or hourly jobs).
- **Streaming**: Processes data continuously in real-time as events occur.
- **Comparison**:
  - Batch jobs typically have a delay but are easier to manage.
  - Streaming allows immediate processing but requires more complex infrastructure.

### Common Batch Processing Intervals

- **Daily**: Most common, processes all collected data at the end of the day.
- **Hourly**: Processes accumulated data for each hour.
- **Weekly/Monthly**: Used for large-scale aggregations or reporting.
- **Less common**: Every few minutes or multiple times per hour.

### Technologies Used

- **Python scripts**: Often used for ingestion and transformation.
- **SQL**: Commonly used for transformations and aggregations.
- **Apache Spark**: A distributed processing engine for handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Other tools**: Frameworks like **Flink** or **Beam** can also be used for batch jobs.

### Workflow Orchestration

- **Airflow**: A popular tool for scheduling and managing batch jobs.
- **Example Workflow**:
  1. Ingest raw data from a **data lake** (CSV files, Parquet, etc.).
  2. Transform the data using **Python** or **SQL**.
  3. Load processed data into a **data warehouse**.
  4. Trigger a **Spark job** for additional processing.

### Apache Spark Overview

- **Definition**: A distributed computing engine for executing large-scale data processing tasks.
- **Key Feature**: Processes data in parallel across multiple machines in a cluster.
- **Common Use Cases**:
  - Large-scale batch processing.
  - Complex data transformations requiring flexibility beyond SQL.
  - Machine learning model training and inference.

### Multi-language Support in Spark

- **Scala**: Native Spark language.
- **Java**: Supported but less commonly used for data engineering.
- **Python (PySpark)**: Popular due to ease of use and integration with machine learning.
- **R**: Available but less commonly used.

### When to Use Spark

- **Use SQL when possible**: Tools like Presto and BigQuery efficiently handle SQL queries.
- **Use Spark when needed**:
  - Processing large, unstructured data files.
  - Complex workflows requiring modular code and testing.
  - Machine learning applications beyond SQL's capabilities.

### Typical Spark Workflow

1. **Raw data is stored** in a cloud data lake (e.g., S3, GCS).
2. **Pre-processing and transformations** are done using SQL tools or Spark.
3. **Advanced processing** (e.g., machine learning) is executed using PySpark or Scala.
4. **Results are stored** back in a data warehouse for analytics.
