# Module 5 Homework

In this homework we'll put what we learned about Spark in practice.

For this homework we will be using the Yellow 2024-10 data from the official website:

```bash
wget https://d37ci6vzurychx.cloudfront.net/trip-data/yellow_tripdata_2024-10.parquet
```

## Question 1: Install Spark and PySpark

- Install Spark
- Run PySpark
- Create a local spark session
- Execute spark.version.

What's the output?

> [!NOTE]
> To install PySpark follow this [guide](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/05-batch/setup/pyspark.md)

## Question 2: Yellow October 2024

Read the October 2024 Yellow into a Spark Dataframe.

Repartition the Dataframe to 4 partitions and save it to parquet.

What is the average size of the Parquet (ending with .parquet extension) Files that were created (in MB)? Select the answer which most closely matches.

- 6MB
- 25MB
- 75MB
- 100MB

## Question 3: Count records

How many taxi trips were there on the 15th of October?

Consider only trips that started on the 15th of October.

- 85,567
- 105,567
- 125,567
- 145,567

I would like to understand, "What exactly is a taxi trip?"

eg. Should we consider:

- `trip duration` > 0
- `trip distance` > 0
- `total_amount` > 0
- `passenger_count` > 0
- `VendorID` not null
- `PULocationID` not null
- `DOLocationID` not null

Those might drastically change the result.
However, considering only the trips starting date as suggested by the question:

- `tpep_pickup_datetime` = '2024-10-15'
